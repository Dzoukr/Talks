## About me

<div class="left-col">
    <img src="images/profile.png" style="height: 300px" />
</div>
<div class="right-col">


Started as single F# developer with no customers

Now with 5 full-time F# developers 

Customers from UAE, United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Finland...

</div>

*******

# Do you really want to be <br/>full-time F# developer?

-------

# Really?

-------

# Really, really?

-------

# Really, really, really...?

-------

# Then I got some bad news for you

*******

##  It's not going to happen over night

<p class="fragment">
    It took me 14 months to get strategic project for F#
</p>

-------

## F# was, is, and always will be .NET language number 2

<p class="fragment">
    Sorry...
</p>


-------

## Problem with F# is not really technical

-------

## It is all about Marketing...

*******

# ... and you are in Marketing now

<p class="fragment">Less coding</p>
<p class="fragment">More talking</p>
<p class="fragment">A lot of strong promises</p>

*******

## Step #1 - Educate colleagues

Show them F#

Use some fancy stuff like Fable

Get their attention

-------

## Never troll them!!!

Don't be "you're doing it wrong" guy (a.k.a jerk)

Don't question their code, tools, metodology

Negative approach leads nowhere

-------

## Be kind!

<p class="fragment">Help</p>
<p class="fragment">Advice</p>
<p class="fragment">Educate</p>

*******

## Step #2 - Seek for internal opportunities

Internal projects

QA department

-------

## QA is gold mine of opportunity!

<br/>

Always understaffed

Always hungry for smart solutions 

UI Automation, data generators, infrastructure

*******

## Step #3 - Publicize your success

Tweets

Success stories on meetups

Whatever you did (if it still breaths) is AWESOME - no fake modesty!

*******

## Step #4 - Attend F# meetups

If it doesn't exist - establish one!

Give talks

Talk to attendees (they are the influencers in their companies)

*******

## Step #5 - Educate competitors

Reply to .NET job offerings

Teach them: .NET is not only C#

Your current competitor can be your future employer

*******

# Already sick of all the marketing?

*******

# Now it is time to educate your boss

*******

Show all your work

Use all dirty tricks (LoC metrics, Less bugs)

Request to be "the F# person" of your company...

...and be ready to give your career in stakes


*******

# LEVEL UP!

*******

# It is done, right?

-------

Nope

*******

## Now Sales department is your new best friend

*******

## Educate customers

Partnership conferences

Newsletters

Lightning talks in office

*******

# You are also travelling F# salesman now
